// big o notation and time complexity

0 (1) static // simple 
0 (log n) divide and conquor the binary search
0 (n) direct with the n


 big o(1) print("Hello World")
 big 0(1) shake hands with teacher
big o(n) shake hands with everyone in the class

big O(1) good morning 
big O(n) rolll call of class

big O(n^2) every student in the class shake hands w every other student

for x=1 to n
print("hello world") // will print n times 
// so this will be big o of n

// nested for loop
for x=1 to n
for y = 1 to n
 print ("hello world")\
// this is big o of n squared becuase its a nested for loop
